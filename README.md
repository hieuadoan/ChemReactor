## üîç Quick Example

```python
from chemreactor.core.base_reactor import Reaction
from chemreactor.reactors.batch_reactor import BatchReactor
from chemreactor.visualization.reactor_animation import ReactorAnimation
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define a reaction: A -> B
reaction = Reaction(
    reactants={'A': 1.0},
    products={'B': 1.0},
    rate_constant=0.1  # min^-1
)

# Initialize a batch reactor
reactor = BatchReactor(
    initial_concentrations={'A': 1.0, 'B': 0.0},
    reactions=[reaction]
)

# Run the simulation
results = reactor.run(end_time=60.0)

# Visualize the results
animator = ReactorAnimation(reactor)
animation = animator.create_batch_animation(results)
plt.show()
```
