# ChemReactor

## üß™ Python-Based Chemical Engineering Reactor Simulation Package

ChemReactor is a powerful, intuitive Python package for modeling, simulating, and visualizing chemical reactor systems. Built specifically for chemical engineers, researchers, and engineering students, it provides tools to explore reaction engineering concepts with interactive visualizations and accurate numerical simulations.

The package focuses on reactor design principles with a highly visual, educational approach that makes chemical reaction engineering more accessible and intuitive for practitioners and students alike.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multiple Reactor Types**: Simulate batch reactors, continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs)
- **Flexible Reaction Modeling**: Define simple or complex reaction networks with customizable kinetics
- **Interactive Visualizations**: See reactions in action with dynamic animations showing species concentrations
- **Robust Numerical Methods**: Powered by scientific Python libraries for accurate solutions to complex ODEs
- **Educational Focus**: Designed specifically for learning and teaching reactor engineering concepts
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new reactor types, kinetic models, or visualization methods

## üîç Quick Example

```python
from chemreactor.core.base_reactor import Reaction
from chemreactor.reactors.batch_reactor import BatchReactor
from chemreactor.visualization.reactor_animation import ReactorAnimation
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define a reaction: A -> B
reaction = Reaction(
    reactants={'A': 1.0},
    products={'B': 1.0},
    rate_constant=0.1  # min^-1
)

# Initialize a batch reactor
reactor = BatchReactor(
    initial_concentrations={'A': 1.0, 'B': 0.0},
    reactions=[reaction]
)

# Run the simulation
results = reactor.run(end_time=60.0)

# Visualize the results
animator = ReactorAnimation(reactor)
animation = animator.create_batch_animation(results)
plt.show()
```
